        <ul>
            <li>If you're traveling from America, particularly anywhere in the midwest or Northeast, flying from Toronto is probably your best bet. We found tickets from Toronto to be very affordable at this time of the year.</li>
            <li>Our flight landed late at night in Lihue Airport, which is situation on the east side of the island, so we picked up our rental car and headed straight to our first lodging - Courtyard (now Sheraton) Kauai at Coconut Beach!
        <ul class="indent">
            <li>In hindsight, we could have stayed at this resort for the entire duration of the trip because of its great location, views, and beach access and since it was cheaper than our other lodging arrangements.

              <li>We woke up early to catch the sunrise starting at 6:30am. Since our hotel was on a beach, there were many fellow guests who also did this; nonetheless, it was a very peaceful and beautiful experience</li>
              <li>We then headed to breakfast at a nearby restaurant called <b>Java Kai</b>, a must if you stay on the east side of the island!</li>
              <li>First on itinerary was <b>Wailua Falls</b> - we drove ~10 miles south to the lookout area (tip: get here early since parking was extremely crowded)</li>
              <li>We then drove to <b>Kauai's Hindu Monastery</b>, which is a very serene and beautiful place to visit</li>
              <li>We then continued touring Kapaa and headed to the <b>'Opaeka'a Falls</b> look out</li>
              <li>By this time, it was lunchtime, so we stopped by nearby food trucks and chowed on some delicious food

              <li>As we continued north, we made several stops at different beaches and lookouts, including:

        In the previous day, we explored the east and north sides of the island. Today, we are going to continue <b>exploring the south side of the beautiful Garden Island:</b>

          <ul>
              <li>Our first stop in the morning was the <b>Menehune Fish Pond</b></li>
              <li>As we continue drove south/west, we came across a tunnel of trees, which we soon learned is a man-made attraction. Take a scenic drive through the <b>Tree Tunnel</b> and simply enjoy the greenery in peace</li>
              <li>We then continued south to the <b>Spouting Horn</b>, which is on the southern coast of the island</li>
              <li>After relaxing and shopping at the nearby merchants, we worked our way back to the hotel</li>
              <li>We drove towards <b>Makauwahi Cave</b>. Here, we ended up getting pretty scared since there were zero cars on the unpaved, beaten dirt road that we were slowly driving on. We ended up seeing one family, who explained that you can drive here to do some small hikes to a nearby beach or to get to the cave reserve (apparently, there is an actual parking lot for the cave reserve, so if you don't feel like braving a pretty nerve-racking drive, you can always do that!). We then walked through the greenery down to <b>Mahaulepu Beach</b>. When we got down, we saw zero tourists - we had the entire beach to ourselves! We spent some quality time and walked through a deadly (there are danger signs, but it's actually quite the opposite) stream. After spending time here, we walked to the actual cave reserve, which was a really cool experience.</li>
              <li>Near the cave, we then visited <b>Lida's Field of Dreams</b>, a small nature preserve with Giant African spurred tortoises and native plants</li>
              <li>At this point, we were ready for lunch and wanted to get closer to Eleele, which is where many NaPali Coast sunset cruises take off from. We drove to a traditional Kauai lunch spot in Hanapepe, called Pa'ina Pono Cafe (mostly locals here but unfortunately, this is now closed down)</li>
              <li>We then continued to Eleele but had some time before the cruise departed (leaves @ 2:30pm), so we stopped at <b>Salt Pond Park</b></li>
              <li>Finally! It was time for our <b>Sunset Dinner Cruise with Capt. Andy</b>, which we cannot recommend enough. This was such a remarkable experience for the entire family! We went on the <b><u>Star Na Pali Dinner Sunset Sail</b></u> (~$30 more per person than the regular Na Pali Dinner Sunset Sail). The eloquent boat, remarkable staff, and friendly guests really made this worth it. This 4-5 hour ride takes you along the coast of the island for some stunning views, while satisfying you along the way. You are served a quality steak and seafood dinner (can do vegetarian, if needed) and can enjoy unlimited cocktails and beverages. If you are lucky, you can see plenty of dolphins and whales (we got to see both, and they really try to get in position for you to see these lovely animals!). This was definitely one of the main highlights of our trip, so be sure to do something similar if you can</li>
              <li>After the sunset cruise, we drove back to the resort and reflected on such an eventful and enjoyable day</li>

              <li>In the morning, we enjoyed an amazing bicycle ride along the beaches of south east coast </b></li>
              <li>We then took an air tour of the island via <b><u>Wings Over Kauai</b></u> - we went on a small propeller plane (only us 4 and the pilot were on it) because it was cheaper than a helicopter and the reviews were (rightfully) remarkable. Our pilot was amazing in sharing the history of the island and also showing us a great time around the island! The views and the experience of going on a small plane made this the highlight of our trip. </li>
              <li>After our air tour, we stopped at <b>Coconut Marketplace</b>, where there was a farmer's market. We tasted a varieties of bread, including pineapple mango and mango chocolate. Also, the honey here is amazing!</li>
              <li>On the way to our 2nd hotel, we stopped for food at <b>Craving Thai Food Truck</b></li>
              <li>Once we checked in to Koloa Landing, we explored Koloa a little bit and tasted some fresh juice at <b>Kauai Juice Company</b>. In the evening, we experienced a <b>Luau Kalamaku</b>, a traditional hula dance show with unlimited alcoholic beverages, and called it a night shortly after</li>

              <li>After some time enjoying the breathtaking views, we went to more food trucks for lunch. We ate at <b>Porky's</b> - this is a must for those who loves hot dogs! Since our parents didn't eat this, they also went to a nearby Thai food truck, which was also super tasty</li>
